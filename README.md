# Very-Simple-Document-Search-Engine
Using the index.py file, the engine searches in the text documents available in the path given. It then builds a dictionary and a posting list for each word. Using the mainwindow designed in QtCreator, a simple UI is available to search a sentence or a word in documents. The engine then does a binary retrieval based on the posting lists built.
The icons file contains the icons needed in the UI and the icons.qrc defines those icons.
